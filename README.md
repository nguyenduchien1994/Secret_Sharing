# RASSS: A Perfidy-Aware Protocol for Designing Trustworthy Distributed Systems
## Description
This repository contains the software implementation for RASSS, a protocol for reconstructing secrets and information in distributed computing systems even in the presence of large number of untrusted participants. The published paper can be found [here](https://github.com/nguyenduchien1994/Secret_Sharing/blob/master/Paper/DFT%20paper.pdf).

The Python program is modularized into separate objects with each object serves to perform a single task within RASSS protocol. We adopted the Finite-Field implementation from [Emin Martinian](http://web.mit.edu/~emin/www.old/source_code/py_ecc/ffield.py) and Reed-Solomon API from [tomerfiliba](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/reedsolomonhttps://github.com/tomerfiliba/reedsolomon).

## How to use?
```
1. git clone
2. run test.py
```
